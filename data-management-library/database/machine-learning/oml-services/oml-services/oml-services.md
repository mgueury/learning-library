# Using REST Services with Oracle Machine Learning

## Introduction



In this workshop, you have a dataset representing 15k customers of an insurance company. Each customer has around 30 attributes, and our goal is to train our database to predict customers life-time value (LTV), or to classify them in predefined classes based on this predicted value.

In marketing, [life-time value (LTV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value) is a prognostication of the net profit contributed to the whole future relationship with a customer.

Estimated Lab Time: 1 hour

### Objectives

In this section we will leverage the Machine Learning models in Autonomous Database using REST APIs. In a situation where the bulk of the data is in Cloud database, we can easily create multiple models and compare them. In addition to that, using REST APIs we can use the most suitable model and score specific data for in the spot prediction or classification.


### Prerequisites
* Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account
* Autonomous Database deployed in Oracle Cloud
* Postman or Curl available on your working station
